In this immersive exploration into detecting the anomalous activity of a ship’s engine, you can practically apply the concepts you've learned over the past few weeks.\n","\n","A poorly maintained ship engine in the supply chain industry can lead to inefficiencies, increased fuel consumption, higher risks of malfunctions, and potential safety hazards. Your challenge in this project is to apply critical thinking and ML concepts to design and implement a robust anomaly detection model.\n","\n","Please set aside approximately **12 hours** to complete the mini-project.\n","\n","<br></br>\n","\n","## **Business context**\n","You are provided with a real data set to identify anomalous activity in a ship’s engine functionality (Devabrat,  2022). As you work through this project, keep in mind that, typically speaking, anomalies would make up a minority of the data points (i.e., about 1% to 5% of the data points would be anomalies).\n","\n","The data set contains six important features continuously monitored to evaluate the engine's status as ‘good’ or ‘bad’. These features are:\n","- **Engine rpm (revolutions per minute):** A high rpm indicates the engine is operating at a higher speed than designed for prolonged periods, which can lead to overheating, excessive wear, and eventual failure. A low rpm could signal a lack of power, issues with fuel delivery, or internal mechanical problems.\n","- **Lubrication oil pressure:** Low lubrication oil pressure indicates insufficient lubrication, leading to increased friction, overheating, and engine damage. A high lubrication oil pressure could signal a blockage in the oil delivery system, potentially causing seal or gasket failure.\n","- **Fuel pressure:** High fuel pressure can cause poor engine performance and incomplete combustion, indicating fuel pump or filter issues. A low fuel pressure may result in excessive fuel consumption, poor emissions, or damage to the fuel injectors.\n","- **Coolant pressure:** Low coolant pressure indicates a potential leak in the cooling system or a coolant pump failure, risking engine overheating. A high coolant pressure could be a sign of a blockage in the cooling system or a failing head gasket, which can also lead to overheating.\n","- **Lubrication oil temperature:** High lubrication oil temperature suggests the oil is overheating, which can degrade its lubricating properties and lead to engine damage. A low lubrication oil temperature may indicate it is not reaching its optimal operating temperature, potentially causing inadequate lubrication.\n","- **Coolant temperature:** High coolant temperature signals overheating, which various issues, including a failed thermostat, coolant leak, or insufficient coolant flow can cause. A low coolant temperature could suggest the engine is not reaching its optimal operating temperature, affecting performance and efficiency.\n","\n","Issues with engines could lead to engine malfunctions, potential safety hazards, and downtime (e.g. delayed deliveries), resulting in the breakdown of a ship’s overall functionality, consequently impacting the business, such as affecting revenue via failure to deliver goods. By predicting timely maintenance, the business aims to increase profit by reducing downtime, reducing safety risks for the crew, limiting fuel consumption, and increasing customer satisfaction through timely deliveries.\n","\n","Your task is to develop a robust anomaly detection system to protect a company’s shipping fleet by evaluating engine functionality. Therefore, you’ll explore the data and:\n","- employ preprocessing and feature engineering\n","- perform anomaly detection.\n","\n","You must prepare a report illustrating your insights to the prospective stakeholders, showing how your solution will save the business money and build trust with its stakeholders. At this stage of the project, the main question you need to consider is:\n","- What insights can be gained from the data, and what recommendations can be made to the company based on these insights? For example, which features need to be monitored closely, and what are the thresholds for anomalous observations? Which statistical or ML technique is the best for anomaly detection based on **this data set**, and which feature (univariate approach) or combination of features (multivariate approach) can predict maintenance?\n","\n","<br></br>\n","\n","> **Disclaimer**\n",">\n","> Please note that although a real-life data set was provided, the business context in this project is fictitious.
