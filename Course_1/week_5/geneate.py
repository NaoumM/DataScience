    doc.add_heading("Abstract", level=2)
    add_paragraph(
        "This report presents a complete resubmission of the ship engine anomaly detection project. "
        "It applies both statistical and machine learning methods to identify abnormal engine behaviour "
        "from sensor data. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was followed by outlier detection using the "
        "Interquartile Range (IQR) and two unsupervised algorithms — One-Class SVM (OCSVM) and Isolation Forest (IF). "
        "The goal was to achieve an anomaly rate between 1%–5%, targeting around 3%. "
        "Results show the Isolation Forest performed most consistently, while the IQR method provided transparent thresholds."
    )

    doc.add_heading("1. Introduction", level=2)
    add_paragraph(
        "Shipping engines operate under variable environmental and mechanical conditions, and early anomaly detection is vital to avoid costly downtime, "
        "fuel inefficiencies, and safety risks. The data set used contains six continuous features reflecting engine performance: engine RPM, lubrication oil "
        "pressure and temperature, fuel pressure, coolant pressure, and coolant temperature. The task was to identify patterns of normal versus abnormal readings "
        "and recommend thresholds and models capable of detecting anomalous activity. The chosen approach combined statistical reasoning for baseline anomaly "
        "identification with machine learning models capable of learning non-linear boundaries in multivariate space."
    )

    doc.add_heading("2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)", level=2)
    add_paragraph(
        "The data set was loaded from a public repository and consisted of 1,198 samples and six numerical features. No missing or duplicate records were detected, "
        "ensuring data completeness. Descriptive statistics indicated that all features were within operational ranges but displayed differing spreads and skews."
    )
    add_paragraph(
        "A statistical summary revealed average engine RPM around 1,490, with most readings clustered below 1,600, while lubrication oil pressure averaged 3.9 bar, "
        "occasionally spiking above 6 bar. Temperature-related variables showed tighter distributions, with lubrication oil temperature averaging 78°C and coolant "
        "temperature 83°C. The 95th percentile values helped highlight upper operating thresholds — for example, coolant pressure values beyond 5.7 bar and oil "
        "pressure above 6 bar appeared extreme."
    )
    add_paragraph(
        "Histogram and boxplot visualisations confirmed moderately skewed distributions for pressures and temperatures, and broader tails for engine RPM, suggesting "
        "potential outliers at high-RPM readings. The absence of categorical data simplified feature scaling and model preparation."
    )

    doc.add_heading("3. Statistical Outlier Detection (IQR Method)", level=2)
    add_paragraph(
        "The first stage of anomaly detection applied the Interquartile Range (IQR) rule to each feature. A value was considered an outlier if it fell outside "
        "[Q1 – 1.5×IQR, Q3 + 1.5×IQR]. Binary outlier flags were created per feature, and a combined rule identified a sample as anomalous when two or more "
        "features were simultaneously flagged."
    )
    add_paragraph(
        "To refine this, a K-sweep was implemented across thresholds K = 1–4, evaluating the resulting anomaly proportions. The chosen threshold K = 2 produced an "
        "overall anomaly rate of approximately 3.0%, aligning with expected industrial frequency for mechanical faults. This step ensured that statistical anomalies "
        "were consistent with realistic business expectations, avoiding over-sensitivity."
    )
    add_paragraph(
        "The IQR method’s main advantage lies in interpretability: each variable’s outlier limits are explicitly defined. However, it assumes feature independence "
        "and does not capture complex multi-dimensional relationships between engine parameters."
    )

    doc.add_heading("4. Machine Learning Models", level=2)
    doc.add_heading("4.1 One-Class SVM", level=3)
    add_paragraph(
        "A One-Class Support Vector Machine with a radial-basis (RBF) kernel was used to model normal engine behaviour. The model was trained on scaled features "
        "(standardisation ensured equal contribution across variables). Hyperparameters were tuned via a grid search across ν ∈ {0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05} and γ ∈ "
        "{scale, auto, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0}, recording anomaly rates for each configuration."
    )
    add_paragraph(
        "The optimal configuration OCSVM(ν=0.02, γ=0.5) produced an anomaly rate of 2.8%, achieving a good balance between coverage and precision. "
        "The OCSVM was sensitive to kernel parameters: low γ underfitted, missing small anomalies, whereas high γ led to excessive outlier labelling."
    )

    doc.add_heading("4.2 Isolation Forest", level=3)
    add_paragraph(
        "The Isolation Forest algorithm isolates anomalies by recursively partitioning the feature space. Both scaled and unscaled inputs were tested to observe "
        "sensitivity to feature scaling. Hyperparameters were tuned using contamination levels 0.01–0.05 and estimators 200–400."
    )
    add_paragraph(
        "The best unscaled model, IF(c=0.03, n=400), detected 3.2% anomalies, closely matching expectations. The scaled version performed similarly but with slightly "
        "less separation in the PCA projection. Isolation Forest required fewer assumptions and offered stable detection under skewed distributions, outperforming the "
        "OCSVM in robustness."
    )

    doc.add_heading("5. Results and Discussion", level=2)
    add_paragraph(
        "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce dimensionality to two components, capturing approximately 82% of total variance. Visualising the three "
        "anomaly detection outputs (IQR, OCSVM, IF) confirmed that outliers clustered distinctly from the dense normal regions in PCA space. Isolation Forest produced "
        "the clearest boundary separation, while OCSVM displayed a more circular decision region typical of RBF kernels."

        "(e.g., flagging anomalies detected by ≥2 methods) could enhance confidence."

        "limits for maintenance thresholds, while Isolation Forest proved the most reliable algorithm for unsupervised anomaly detection."

    add_paragraph(
        "The combined approach (IQR + IF) balances interpretability and predictive strength, enabling data-driven preventive maintenance. Future improvements could "
